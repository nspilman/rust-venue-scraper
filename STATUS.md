# SMS Server Rust - Implementation Status

## Current Implementation State

### âœ… Core Infrastructure Complete
- **Project Setup**: Cargo.toml with all necessary dependencies
- **CLI Interface**: Full command-line interface with ingester/carpenter/run modes
- **Logging System**: Structured logging with tracing, file outputs, and proper levels
- **Error Handling**: Custom error types with proper error propagation
- **Configuration**: TOML-based config system with environment variable support

### âœ… Architecture Foundation
- **EventApi Trait**: Strategy pattern implementation for data sources
- **Pipeline System**: Complete data flow orchestration from ingestion to output
- **Storage Abstraction**: Interface layer for data persistence (ready for DB integration)
- **Type System**: Comprehensive data models for Events, Venues, Artists, Raw Data

### âœ… Working Data Sources
1. **Blue Moon Tavern Crawler** (`src/apis/blue_moon.rs`)
   - HTML parsing and data extraction
   - Event scheduling logic
   - Error handling and logging

2. **Sea Monster Lounge Crawler** (`src/apis/sea_monster.rs`)
   - Web scraping implementation
   - Data transformation

### ðŸš§ Partially Implemented
- **Carpenter System**: Framework exists but needs full data processing logic
- **Storage Layer**: In-memory implementation complete, PostgreSQL integration pending
- **Data Models**: Core structures defined, need database schema mapping

### ðŸ“‹ Next Priority Items

#### High Priority (Critical Path)
1. **Database Integration**
   - Implement PostgreSQL connection with SQLx
   - Create database schema migrations
   - Replace in-memory storage with real database operations

2. **Complete Carpenter Logic**
   - Implement venue creation/matching logic
   - Add artist extraction and management
   - Build event deduplication and update logic
   - Add proper change tracking and audit logging

3. **Add Ticketmaster API Integration**
   - Most important external API (mentioned in config.toml)
   - High data volume and reliability
   - Reference implementation for other APIs

#### Medium Priority
4. **Remaining Web Crawlers**
   - Darrell's Tavern
   - Little Red Hen  
   - Skylark
   - The Royal Room

5. **External API Integrations**
   - AXS, Dice, Eventbrite, Songkick, Bandsintown, Tixr, Venuepilot

6. **Data Quality Features**
   - Idempotency for repeat runs
   - Duplicate detection across sources
   - Data validation and cleaning rules

#### Low Priority
7. **Open Mic Generation**
   - Recurring event logic for scheduled open mics
   - Venue-specific scheduling rules

8. **Production Features**
   - Enhanced monitoring and metrics
   - Deployment configuration
   - Performance optimization

## Technical Debt & Improvements Needed

### Storage Layer
- Current in-memory storage is functional but won't persist data
- Need proper database schema design
- Transaction management for data consistency

### Error Handling
- Basic error propagation works but could be more granular
- Need better error categorization (retriable vs permanent failures)
- Enhanced logging for debugging production issues

### Configuration Management  
- Basic TOML config exists but lacks comprehensive API settings
- Need environment-specific configurations
- Secret management for API keys

### Testing
- Limited unit tests currently
- Need integration tests for crawlers
- End-to-end pipeline testing

## Migration Progress vs Original Plan

**âœ… Completed from Migration Plan:**
- Dual-component pipeline (Ingester/Carpenter)
- Strategy pattern via EventApi trait
- ETL architecture
- Asynchronous HTTP with tokio/reqwest
- HTML parsing with scraper
- Standalone executable
- Basic configuration management

**ðŸš§ In Progress:**
- Database compatibility (structures ready, connection pending)
- Idempotency (framework ready, logic needed)
- Logging & auditing (basic logging done, detailed tracking needed)

**ðŸ“‹ Not Started:**
- Most external API integrations
- Open mic generation
- Complete source management registry
- Advanced error recovery
