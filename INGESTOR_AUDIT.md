# Ingestor Audit Against Platonic Ideal

## Executive Summary

This audit compares the current implementation of the rust-venue-scraper-clean ingestor against the architectural principles and requirements described in PLATONIC_IDEAL.md. The implementation demonstrates strong compliance with the early stages of the pipeline (Sources → Gateway → Ingest Log → Parse) but is missing several downstream stages that are crucial for the complete vision.

## Compliance Assessment by Stage

### ✅ 1. Sources and Registry
**Platonic Ideal**: "Keep a simple registry that says what we're allowed to collect and under what rules"

**Implementation Status**: **COMPLIANT**
- ✅ Registry implemented in `src/registry.rs` with `SourceSpecV1` structure
- ✅ Registry includes source enablement, endpoints, content rules, and rate limits
- ✅ Registry files stored in `registry/sources/*.json`
- ✅ Policy specification with `license_id` for legal compliance
- ✅ Rate limiting enforced per registry specifications

**Evidence**:
- Registry properly defines allowed MIME types, max payload sizes
- Each source has explicit policy and content specifications
- Rate limiter implementation respects registry-defined limits

### ✅ 2. Ingestion Gateway
**Platonic Ideal**: "Checks labels, enforces policy and fairness, prevents duplicates, freezes original bytes in immutable raw store"

**Implementation Status**: **MOSTLY COMPLIANT**
- ✅ Duplicate prevention via idempotency keys (SQLite-backed)
- ✅ Immutable raw store implemented (CAS with SHA256)
- ✅ Clean handoff with stamped envelopes
- ✅ Gateway sets acceptance timestamps and envelope IDs
- ⚠️ Policy enforcement is basic (only license_id tracking)
- ❌ No fairness mechanisms beyond rate limiting

**Evidence**:
- Gateway properly deduplicates using `IngestMeta` SQLite store
- CAS implementation in `cas_fs.rs` ensures immutability
- Both filesystem and Supabase storage options available
- Missing: advanced policy checks, quarantine mechanisms

### ✅ 3. Ingest Log
**Platonic Ideal**: "Steady conveyor belt... carries envelopes in predictable order... makes replays safe"

**Implementation Status**: **COMPLIANT**
- ✅ Append-only NDJSON log files
- ✅ Daily rotation with consistent naming pattern
- ✅ Preserves envelope order
- ✅ Contains pointers to immutable raw bytes
- ✅ Supports replay without re-fetching sources

**Evidence**:
- `ingest_log.rs` implements rotating daily logs
- Each envelope is preserved with full metadata
- Symlink maintains current log reference

### ⚠️ 4. Parse
**Platonic Ideal**: "Reads envelope, follows pointer to raw bytes, decodes into neutral records with provenance"

**Implementation Status**: **PARTIALLY COMPLIANT**
- ✅ Parse use case defined with proper abstraction
- ✅ Reads from CAS using payload references
- ✅ Maintains envelope_id and source_id for provenance
- ❌ No evidence of "neutral record" output format
- ❌ Parser implementations appear incomplete

**Evidence**:
- `ParseUseCase` structure exists but lacks concrete implementations
- Factory pattern prepared but parsers not fully implemented

### ❌ 5. Normalize
**Platonic Ideal**: "Puts records into single, consistent geospatial shape"

**Implementation Status**: **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- No normalize stage found in codebase
- No coordinate harmonization logic
- No canonical feature format defined

### ❌ 6. Quality Gate
**Platonic Ideal**: "Calm checkpoint... accepts, warns, or quarantines with clear reasons"

**Implementation Status**: **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- No quality gate implementation
- No quarantine mechanisms
- No quality rules or validation beyond basic envelope validation

### ❌ 7. Enrich
**Platonic Ideal**: "Adds context... tags with city/district... spatial bins"

**Implementation Status**: **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- No enrichment stage
- No spatial binning
- No geographic tagging logic

### ❌ 8. Conflation
**Platonic Ideal**: "Turns many mentions into one stable thing... assigns durable IDs"

**Implementation Status**: **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- No entity resolution logic
- No durable ID assignment beyond envelope IDs
- No mention-to-entity mapping

### ❌ 9. Catalog
**Platonic Ideal**: "Organized memory... Nodes with durable IDs... GraphQL types define shapes"

**Implementation Status**: **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- GraphQL schema exists but not connected to pipeline
- No catalog storage implementation
- No Node/Edge persistence logic

## Core Principles Compliance

### ✅ Immutability
- Raw bytes are properly immutable in CAS
- Ingest log is append-only

### ✅ Provenance
- Envelope structure maintains source tracking
- Timestamps preserved at multiple stages

### ⚠️ Determinism
- Input handling is deterministic
- Missing stages prevent full determinism assessment

### ⚠️ Loose Coupling
- Good separation between gateway and sources
- Missing stages prevent full assessment

### ❌ Fairness at the Door
- Basic rate limiting exists
- Advanced fairness mechanisms not implemented

## Critical Gaps

1. **Missing Pipeline Stages**: The implementation stops after Parse, missing 5 of 9 stages
2. **No Data Transformation**: No normalize, enrich, or conflation logic
3. **No Quality Control**: Missing quality gate and quarantine mechanisms
4. **No Final Storage**: Catalog stage completely absent
5. **Limited Policy Enforcement**: Only basic license tracking, no content validation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Priorities
1. Implement Normalize stage to create consistent data format
2. Add Quality Gate with quarantine capabilities
3. Complete Parse stage implementations for all sources

### Medium-term Goals
1. Build Enrich stage with geographic tagging
2. Implement Conflation for entity resolution
3. Create Catalog with proper Node/Edge storage

### Architecture Improvements
1. Add comprehensive policy enforcement in Gateway
2. Implement fairness mechanisms beyond rate limiting
3. Add operational metrics for all pipeline stages
4. Create replay/recovery mechanisms for each stage

## Conclusion

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for the first third of the Platonic Ideal pipeline. The registry, gateway, and ingest log components are well-implemented and align with the architectural vision. However, the system is incomplete without the downstream transformation and storage stages. To achieve the "calm, explainable end-to-end data flow" described in the Platonic Ideal, significant development work remains on the Parse through Catalog stages.

The implementation demonstrates good engineering practices in the completed portions but needs substantial work to fulfill the complete vision of a deterministic, replayable, and fully traceable data pipeline.
